<p>You tourists moving in causes problems for everyone</p>
<p>Stop moving in nobody wants you here. You're just making the rent go up for the lower class, and I'm pretty sure only 10% of you guys moving here can afford these high rise apartments.</p>
  <p>It's not great here either. You people with your noodle brains and glorified perspectives of NYC wouldn't know that of course. So let me show you why.</p>
    <p>NYC is a better city to visit than live in TikTok's aren't always the truth. Stop listening to these people that move here and live in lifesize cardboard boxes.</p>
